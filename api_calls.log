The motion of the whole is the sum of the motions of all its parts. For instance, in a body double in quantity with equal velocity, the motion is double; with twice the velocity, it is quadruple. Newton distinguishes force by defining vis insita, or innate force of matter, as a power of resisting. He also discusses motive force and accelerative force. The motive force arises from the accelerative force drawn into the quantity of matter. The accelerative force is proportional to the quantity of matter in another globe applied to the square of the distance between the centers of two globes. The motive force, which is commonly called weight in terrestrial bodies, is proportional to the content under the quantities of matter in both globes applied to the square of the distance between their centers. The quantity of motion is proportional to this motive force.", "The provided information does not list Newtons three laws of motion. However, it does state that Newton demonstrated Keplers three laws to be true. From Keplers first law, Newton inferred that the force retaining a planet in its orbit was always directed to the sun. From Keplers second law, which states that every planet moves in an ellipse with the sun in one of its foci, Newton drew more general conclusions. The text also mentions that Newton discovered the laws of motion and gravitation, and that gravity acts according to explained laws, abundantly accounting for all the motions of celestial bodies and the sea. Newton derived the forces of gravity with which bodies tend to the sun and planets from mathematical propositions, and from these forces, he deduced the motions of planets, comets, the moon, and the sea. The text also refers to the third Law of motion in the context of estimating the action of an agent from its force and velocity, and the reaction of an impediment from the velocities of its parts and forces of resistance.", "From Keplers first law, which states the proportionality of areas to the times of their description, Newton inferred that the force retaining a planet in its orbit was always directed towards the sun. The answer to this question is not available in the provided information.", "Newton demonstrates that the force of gravity towards the several equal particles of any body is reciprocally as the square of the distance of places from the particles, as appears from Cor. 3, Prop. LXXIV, Book I. He also states that the weight of either sphere towards the other will be reciprocally as the square of the distance between their centers, provided the matter in places on all sides around and equidistant from the centers is similar. Furthermore, he notes that the forces of particles exerted upon a body are as the particles directly, and the squares of the distances inversely.", "Newtons argument for the universal gravitation of all bodies is based on the observation that the earth gravitates towards the moon, the sea gravitates towards the moon, all planets mutually gravitate towards one another, and comets gravitate towards the sun. He concludes that, in consequence of this rule, all bodies whatsoever are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation. This argument from appearances concludes with more force for the universal gravitation of all bodies than for their impenetrability.", "The provided information does not explain how Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets.", "Newton used the fundamental principle of his fluxionary calculus in the second Lemma of the second book of Principia. The provided information does not state why he did not use standard calculus notation.", "Newton explains orbital motion by stating that bodies in orbit endeavor to recede from the centers of their orbits. If not for a contrary force that restrains them and keeps them in their orbits, they would fly off in straight lines with uniform motion. This restraining force, which he calls centripetal force, is what keeps bodies in their orbits.", "Newtons work addresses the motion of bodies projected in resisting mediums and acted upon by an uniform force of gravity. It also covers bodies revolving in resisting mediums and funependulous bodies in resisting mediums. The resistance of fluids is also discussed, as is motion propagated through fluids and the motion of fluids after the manner of a vortex or circular. In slow motions, the resistance may be slightly less because the figure of a globe is more adapted to motion than the figure of a cylinder with the same diameter. In swift motions, the resistance may be slightly greater because the elasticity and compression of the fluid do not increase in the duplicate ratio of the velocity. Newton states he does not take notice of these little niceties. It is manifest that in elastic fluids of the same density, when bodies move with extreme swiftness, their resistances are nearly equal, whether the fluids consist of gross parts or of parts ever so subtle. The resistance of projectiles moving with exceedingly great celerities is not much diminished by the subtilty of the medium. The excess of pressure in a fluid, in proportion to its quantity, not only excites motion in the fluid but also acts upon the projectile to retard its motion. Therefore, the resistance in every fluid is as the motion excited by the projectile in the fluid. In continued mediums like water, hot oil, and quicksilver, a globe passing through them does not immediately strike all the particles of the fluid that generate resistance. Instead, it presses only the particles next to it, which press the particles beyond, and so on. In these mediums, the resistance is diminished by one half.", "Newtons notion of absolute space and time differs from relative motion in that true motion does not consist in relations, whereas relative motion can be changed when true motion remains unaltered. True motion suffers change from any impressed force, but relative motion does not necessarily undergo change from such forces if the same forces are impressed on other bodies to preserve relative position. The effects that distinguish absolute from relative motion include the forces of receding from the axis of circular motion, which are present in true and absolute circular motion but not in purely relative circular motion. The provided information does not explicitly detail how this supports Newtons laws.", "Robert Newton was the grandfather of Isaac Newton.", "Beyond the grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac cannot with certainty be traced."]}}
