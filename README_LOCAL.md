# Document Search API - Local Development Setup

This guide will help you run the Document Search API locally on your PC and expose it using Cloudflare tunnel.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

**For Windows:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements_windows.txt
```

**For Linux/Mac:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables
Copy `env_example.txt` to `.env` and fill in your API keys:
```bash
cp env_example.txt .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your Google API key:
```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_google_api_key
```

### 3. Start the Application

**Option A: Using the batch file (Windows)**
```bash
start_local.bat
```

**Option B: Using PowerShell script (Windows)**
```powershell
.\start_local.ps1
```

**Option C: Using Python directly**
```bash
python run_local.py
```

### 4. Expose with Cloudflare Tunnel
In a new terminal:
```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8000
```

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Google API Key for Gemini
- Cloudflare account (for tunnel)

## üîß Installation Steps

### 1. Python Setup
Make sure Python is installed and in your PATH.

### 2. Install Cloudflare Tunnel
**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-windows-amd64.exe" -OutFile "cloudflared.exe"
```

**Alternative (Chocolatey):**
```powershell
choco install cloudflared
```

### 3. Get Google API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Add it to your `.env` file

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

### Method 1: Simple Start
```bash
python run_local.py
```

### Method 2: Windows Batch File
```bash
start_local.bat
```

### Method 3: Direct Uvicorn
```bash
uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

## üåê Exposing Your Local Server

### Option 1: Cloudflare Tunnel (Recommended)
```bash
# Quick temporary tunnel
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8000

# Or create a permanent tunnel
cloudflared tunnel create my-api
cloudflared tunnel route dns my-api your-subdomain.yourdomain.com
cloudflared tunnel run my-api
```

### Option 2: ngrok
```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

### Option 3: localtunnel
```bash
npx localtunnel --port 8000
```

## üì° API Endpoints

Once running, your API will be available at:
- **Local**: http://localhost:8000
- **Public**: https://your-tunnel-url.com

### Available Endpoints:
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `POST /upload-url` - Upload document from URL
- `POST /upload-file` - Upload document file
- `POST /search` - Search documents
- `POST /hackrx/run` - Process multiple questions

### API Documentation:
- **Swagger UI**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **ReDoc**: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## üîí Security Considerations

1. **Local Access Only**: The app runs on `127.0.0.1` (localhost only)
2. **HTTPS via Tunnel**: Cloudflare provides SSL encryption
3. **API Key Protection**: Keep your `.env` file secure
4. **Firewall**: Consider firewall rules for additional security

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables
Key variables in `.env`:
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 8000)

### Database Options
- **SQLite** (default): `sqlite:///./test.db`
- **PostgreSQL**: `postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   # Change port in .env
   PORT=8001
   ```

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **API Key Issues**
   - Verify your Google API key is correct
   - Check if you have sufficient quota

4. **Tunnel Connection Issues**
   - Ensure your app is running on the correct port
   - Check Cloudflare tunnel status

### Logs
The application logs to console. Check for:
- Service initialization messages
- Error messages
- API request logs

## üìä Monitoring

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Service Status
The `/health` endpoint returns:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "models_loaded": true
}
```

### Main endpoint `/hackrx/run`
The endpoint that actually recieves POST requests
and gives out result:
Input Format:
```json
POST /hackrx/run
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer 41c2a6a277102861eaaf91a1bd77f852c1c8970e8ec3a5b2d86fdd5960c581e3

## How to Run on Google Colab

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository
```bash
!git clone https://github.com/Bada-Don/Bajaj.git
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies
```bash
!pip install -r Bajaj/requirements_windows.txt
!pip install python-magic python-dotenv PyPDF2 python-docx faiss-gpu-cu11 rank_bm25
!pip install pyngrok nest_asyncio uvicorn
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Preload documents
```bash
!python Bajaj/preload_doc.py
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Start the API with ngrok tunnel
```python
from pyngrok import ngrok
import nest_asyncio
import subprocess
import time

# ‚úÖ Your ngrok auth token (get it from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken)
NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN = "ENTER THE ACTUALL NGROK AUTH TOKEN HERE"

# Apply async patch for running in notebooks
nest_asyncio.apply()

# Set auth token
ngrok.set_auth_token(NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN)

# Start your API in the background
process = subprocess.Popen(["python", "Bajaj/run_local.py"])

# Wait for uvicorn to start
time.sleep(20)

# Open the ngrok tunnel
public_url = ngrok.connect(8000)
print("=" * 50)
print("üöÄ YOUR PUBLIC API IS LIVE! üöÄ")
print(f"Endpoint URL: {public_url}")
print("=" * 50)

# Keep notebook alive until interrupted
try:
    while True:
        time.sleep(1)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Shutting down...")
    process.terminate()
    ngrok.kill()
```

---

‚úÖ **Note:**  
- Always replace the `NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN` with your own from the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).  
- You must run the API cell **last** so that the notebook stays active while serving your endpoint.


1. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   python run_local.py
   ```

2. **Start Tunnel** (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Test Your API**:
   - Use the provided URL from Cloudflare
   - Test endpoints via Swagger UI
   - Monitor logs in both terminals

4. **Stop Services**:
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in both terminals

## üìù Notes

- The application uses SQLite by default for simplicity
- All models are loaded on startup
- File uploads are limited to 10MB
- The app supports auto-reload during development

## üÜò Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the logs for error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Check if the port is available
